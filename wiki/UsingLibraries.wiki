#summary How to use javascript libraries with the qunit runner

= Introduction =

If you use any libraries, whether those are your own or external ones, you need to tell the phanromjs-qunit-runner which javascript file need to be available when running the tests.

= Example =

You can do this by including a libraries section in the configuration for the plugin, as in the following example:

{{{
                <configuration>
                    <jsSourceDirectory>src/main/javascript/</jsSourceDirectory>
                    <jsTestDirectory>src/test/javascript/</jsTestDirectory>
                    <ignoreFailures>false</ignoreFailures>
                    <phantomJsExec>/home/.../opt/phantomjs/bin/phantomjs</phantomJsExec>
                    <libraries>
                        <directory>src/test/javascript/lib/</directory>
                        <includes>
                            <include>**/*.js</include>
                        </includes>
                    </libraries>
                </configuration>
}}}

The libraries tag is a normal [http://maven.apache.org/shared/file-management/examples/mojo.html maven file management] section, supports includes and excludes. You can currently add only one directory to this section, so all library files should be in the same place.
